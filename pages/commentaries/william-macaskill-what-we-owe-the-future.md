> improving institutions like national governments and international governance bodies could bring about positive trajectory changes

## Population ethics

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ethics

>Population ethics is the philosophical study of the ethical problems arising when our actions affect who is born and how many people are born in the future. An important area within population ethics is population axiology, which is "the study of the conditions under which one state of affairs is better than another, when the states of affairs in question may differ over the numbers and the identities of the persons who ever live."
