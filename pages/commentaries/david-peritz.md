# David Peritz

At your talk at Heritage on the Marina on August 26, you presented a host of issues thay may serve to confound life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

When asked what could be done to alter the course of events, you suggested "regulate media"

I am totally with you that media is the disruptor, but I have difficulty imagining ways that media could be regulated.

Rather than turning way, it might be fruitful to to examine the current state of media and identify where things might be un-dissembled.
