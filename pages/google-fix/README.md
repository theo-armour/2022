Unable to receive SMS verification message; unable to receive calls from new numbers

My Samsung S21 Ultra continues to not be able to receive text messages from Lyft, Uber, WhatsApp, GitHub and other sources. Callers who I have not previously phoned receive the message "Unable to complete the call, Please try later".

This issue has been happening for over a year.

I recently purchased a SIM card from T-Mobile.

With the new T-Mobile number, I have received text verification numbers from all the above sources on the same phone.

In other words: All the SMS messages that Google FI is blocking, T-Mobile is sending through.


I would like to keep my family plan with Google FI and also have a phone that works well.

Do you have any suggestions?


yes

Hi Lyft Support

The Lyft app is sending SMS verification codes to my number 415 828 000 but they are not arriving on my phone. There same thing happens with Uber and GitHub apps. Otherwise all verification codes from other apps are coming through. My phone service is via GooGle Fi and the problem is most likely an issue with their service. I have been in touch with them very frequently. They seem to be working on the issue but it has not been resolved yet. I have tried using a temporary number (415 644 8890) but that number is also failing.

In the meantime, I would really, really like to to be using Lyft again. Please can you help my phone to be re-authorized using some other method?

Theo

Hi Krishana

Thank you for taking this case on.

>> It seems that the issues are only with the Lynk app on your device.

Actually, currently there are two codes that do not work: Lyft is one plus one of the Google codes. The third one (for Uber) mysteriously started working again. Would you like me to search for others?

>> I suggest you check the permissions for the Lynk App on your device

Which device? I am currently testing on four devices? ;-)

BTW, I checked the Google Pixel 5. It reports "no permissions denied" for the Lyft app.
